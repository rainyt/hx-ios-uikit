A service identifier array is passed which can be used to filter or prioritize the credentials that closely match each service.  The service identifier array could have zero or more items. If there are more than one item in the array, items with lower indexes  represent more specific identifiers for which a credential is being requested. For example, the array could contain identifiers  [m.example.com, example.com] with the first item representing the more specifc service that requires a credential.  If the array of service identifiers is empty, it is expected that the credential list should still show credentials that the user can pick from.  */

If your extension can accomplish this (for example, the userâ€™s passwords database is  still unlocked from a recent interaction), call -[ASCredentialProviderExtensionContext completeRequestWithSelectedCredential:completionHandler:]  to provide the credential.

For example, if your extension requires user interaction  because the passwords database needs to be unlocked, pass an error with code ASExtensionErrorCodeUserInteractionRequired.  @note When this method is called, your extension's view controller is not present on the screen.
